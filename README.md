# Legal Topic Modeling

This repository contains the code for replicating the experiments described in the paper:

> Martina Saletta, Chiara Gallese, Luca Manzoni and Alberto Bartoli. *Topic Models in Legal Texts: a Case Study on Italian Constitutional Court Judgments*. Submitted for peer review.

The dataset can be downloaded from: 
<https://gitlab.com/CIRSFID/cortecostituzionale-py>
in the directory
    ./data/sources/xml/all

All the experiments have been performed on a Linux machine with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 
If you run the code on different operating systems, some requirements should be a bit different. If you are on Windows, paths must be expressed in Windows/DOS format, and backslashes sometimes need to be escaped.
